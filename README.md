# 🛡️ PhishShield AI  
### Real-Time Phishing URL Detection System (PyTorch + FastAPI)

🚀 **Live Demo:** https://phishshield-ai-hqoq.onrender.com/docs

PhishShield AI is an end-to-end machine learning and backend security system designed to detect phishing URLs in real-time.  
The system leverages engineered URL intelligence features and a deep neural network classifier to provide scalable REST API-based threat detection.

Built to simulate production-level cybersecurity infrastructure, the project demonstrates ML model development, performance optimization, and API deployment using FastAPI.

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|--------|--------|
| ROC-AUC | **0.8818** |
| Precision | **0.7797** |
| Recall | **0.8206** |
| F1 Score | **0.7997** |
| Optimized Threshold | **0.39** |

The model is optimized for high recall to reduce missed phishing attacks in cybersecurity scenarios.

## 🧠 Feature Engineering

The system extracts 15+ handcrafted lexical and reference-based features from URLs, including:

- HTTPS presence
- IP address detection in URL
- URL length
- Host length
- Path depth
- Number of dots in host
- Number of digits in URL
- Query parameter count
- Suspicious symbol detection (@, fragments)
- Reference phishing hit ratio
- Benign reference hits
- Host anomaly indicators

Features are normalized using `StandardScaler` before model inference.

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Health Check

```
GET /health
```

Returns server status.

---

### Predict URL

```
POST /predict
```

#### Example Request:

```json
{
  "url": "http://paypal-login-security-check.com"
}
```

#### Example Response:

```json
{
  "label": "phish",
  "score": 0.82,
  "details": { ... }
}
```
**Score Interpretation:**  
The `score` field represents the predicted phishing probability (after sigmoid activation).  
A decision threshold of **0.39** (optimized during training) is applied for classification:
- Score ≥ 0.39 → `"phish"`
- Score < 0.39 → `"benign"`

This threshold was selected to maximize F1-score and improve phishing recall.
